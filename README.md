# CITUR
Create iso to use [the windows version of Rosehip](https://github.com/donno2048/Rosehip)

Run init.sh in linux to create the iso using `yes | sudo bash ./init.sh` (this might take up to five hours!)

In the iso run the word rosehip to open the desktop

Make sure you are using internet which doesn't require any special certificate.

Right now the only problem is Rosehip is written for windows but the iso is linux formated...

You can also use [the linux version of CITUR](https://github.com/donno2048/CITUR-L) corresponding to [the linux version of Rosehip](https://github.com/donno2048/Rosehip-L)

The windows iso and the linux iso both using the same [VM setup steps](https://gist.github.com/donno2048/2fb40cc45e742a03feddb957896bfdb6) and [bootable USB setup steps](https://gist.github.com/donno2048/eb2144ad6afb82f65d1cd08a876179c8) after you have the iso file

If you don't want to actually build the iso but only check how would it look like, you should checkout [the web version of Rosehip](https://github.com/donno2048/Rosehip-repl)
