# CITUR
create iso to use [the windows version of Rosehip](https://github.com/donno2048/Rosehip)

run init.sh in linux to create the iso using `sudo bash ./init.sh` (this might take up to five hours!)

in the iso run the word rosehip to open the desktop

make sure you are using internet which doesn't require any special certificate.

right now the only problem is Rosehip is written for windows but the iso is linux formated...

you can also use [the linux version of CITUR](https://github.com/donno2048/CITUR-L)

the windows iso and the linux iso both using the same [setup steps](https://gist.github.com/donno2048/2fb40cc45e742a03feddb957896bfdb6) after you have the iso file
